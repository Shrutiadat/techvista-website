## 🎨 Prompt Engineering Approach

This project utilized a **two-tier prompting system**:

### 1. Master Meta-Prompt
A comprehensive foundation prompt establishing:
- Technical requirements (HTML5, CSS3, responsive design)
- Design standards (spacing, typography, colors)
- Code quality guidelines (semantic HTML, accessibility)
- Visual quality requirements

### 2. Section-Specific Prompts
Detailed prompts for each of the 5 website sections, including:
- Component requirements
- Design specifications
- Responsive behavior
- Accessibility standards
- Testing checklist
